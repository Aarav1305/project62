    <h1>My thought</h1>
 <hr>
    <p>Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. Drawing is my favorite hobby.
        I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.I like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look alive.The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps & is still improving. I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.</p>
